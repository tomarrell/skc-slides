## Extended Blurb

Software engineering is about systematic approaches applied to large software projects, typically with many team members and large amounts of program code, so that the products behave reliably and efficiently, are affordable to develop and maintain, and satisfy customer requirements. This area can be explored by learning about common software engineering methodologies (including examples of “plan-driven” and “agile” approaches) and the different roles and skills required in a software engineering project, particularly analysis, development, testing and maintenance. Understanding can be demonstrated by doing **case studies of software projects through interviews with software engineers,** researching reports about successful and unsuccessful projects, running a simulation of a software engineering project, or **reflecting on teamwork experiences that simulate the issues that arise in software engineering.** The report should discuss the main issues and **compare different approaches in the context of commercial projects that involve multiple team members.** This topic is distinct from the programming standards because it explores large systems developed by teams of people; participating in such a project is way beyond the scope of Level 3 work, and the expectation is that students will review commercial or simulated projects, rather than run one themselves.
